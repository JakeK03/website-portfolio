        <p><span class="underline">Circadian Rythmn</span> is an idea that began by trying to conjure the feeling of missing home. The rythmn I have is different in every place I live. The time I get up in New York means a three hour shift in time zones from back home in Portland. Seasons are different, and the sun is different. I wanted to be able to digitize that moment of glancing into an aspect of my life I normally can't see. Through looking at a webcam of <span class="underline">Mount Hood</span> in Oregon—the backdrop to my childhood—I could feel a sense of connection. The time the sun rises and after it sets is a chance to wake up and go to bed in that time hypothetically. To update my understanding of change by looking through a portal online. <br><br><span class="underline">By having the site function like an alarm, only working when the sun is up</span>, allows me and the users to embrace limitations. Through this, I hope to garner that time is not infinite, and that the digital world is a horizon which can be good, but also destructive. By looking back on things—literally—from the East coast over to the West, I can embrace my idea of tactility and limitation of the online space. We often get too comfortable approaching things with a sense of limitless possibility. That being online, resources are infinite. Yet websites have a part in global deterioration. Sites don't need to be on all the time. And this is where my idea sprang from.</p>
